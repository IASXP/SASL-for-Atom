# SASL-for-Atom
Essentially the same as my SASL-for-VSCode snippets file.
NOT TESTED ON MAC OR LINUX
### AFAIK You Cannot Have More Than One Snippets File In Atom.

## Users On Windows:
Download the ```snippets.cson``` file and put it into 
```C:\Users\user\.atom```
## Users on Mac or Linux
I do not know the file location for this. Sorry! You might be able to 
search up the file location for snippets and paste this file there.
